# Tuples are like lists, but unlike lists they cannot be changed after being
# defined. In programming, we refer to this quality as being IMMUTABLE
# Tuples are bound by bracket ()

my_number = (2,3,4,5,6,7)

print("Print item at index 4:", my_number[4])
print(my_number)

# Tuples are typically used to house constants..
